## About

This app was inspired by LumoHacks topic of mental health issues in veterans and first responders. 
BritherTime has multiple functionalities such as providing a 
support group for the people at risk of depression while
keeping it anonymous, confidential, and therapeutic. This app consits of a wall where the users can share their 
thoughts anonymously. The users can play a game, answer a series of questions about some real 
life situations and based on their answers, the app will analyze their risk of depression. This app uses 
machine learning to evaluate the language used in the responses and 
The list of users with higher risk will be presented to a group of trained professionals where they 
can chose to reach out to the user via an emailing system.
